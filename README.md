## 🚀 Project Overview
A-SCENT (Attock Spiral Digital Twin) is a high-fidelity simulation tool designed to optimize the performance of a spiral concentrator. It bridges the gap between theoretical mineral processing and industrial application by providing a real-time interactive dashboard.

## 🛠️ Key Features
* **Real-time Simulation:** Adjust Feed Rate, Solids %, and d80 to see instant impacts on recovery.
* **AI Process Optimizer:** Automatically predicts the most profitable operating conditions.
* **Economic Modeling:** Includes detailed OPEX (Labor, Power, Mining) and Revenue calculations.
* **Financial Sensitivity:** A "What-If" analysis tool to check profitability against market price drops.
* **Automated Reporting:** Generates a professional executive summary in Word/PDF format.

## 🧬 Engineering Logic
The twin uses a penalty-based recovery model:
- **Size Factor:** Adjusts recovery based on feed d80.
- **Solids Penalty:** Accounts for high-viscosity losses in dense slurries.
- **Mass Balance:** Calculates concentrate and tailings split based on splitter positioning.
